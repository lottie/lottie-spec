# Lottie Animation Format

Welcome to the official documentation for Lottie,
a JSON-based format for animated vector graphics.

This manual contains formal specification and documentation for the
Lottie file format, offering insights into its structure and features.

The main target audience for this manual are developers that want to
create tools within the Lottie ecosystem as it provides details about
the JSON internals.


## Status of this manual

The Lottie specification is still a work in progress, this document
contains a subset of features that have been approved by the
Lottie Animation Community. The documentation and specs will be expanded
as more of the Lottie format becomes standardized.

Once the draft is complete, there will be an announcement by the
Lottie Animation Community.


## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when,
they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


## Document Structure

Lottie documents MUST use JSON [RFC8259] to structure their data.
The top-level object in a Lottie document MUST be an
[Animation](./specs/composition.md#animation) object.

Implementation MAY store additional data in the JSON objects.

A machine-readable specification of the JSON structure is available
as [JSON Schema](./specs/schema.md).


## Where to start

Since Lottie uses JSON, basic JSON knowledge is required to understand the specification.

To understand Lottie data, it's useful to start learning about
[basic values](./specs/values.md) and [animated properties](./specs/properties.md).

The root object of any Lottie animation is the [Animation](./specs/composition.md#animation) object.

A printable single-page version of the specification is available [here](./print_page).
