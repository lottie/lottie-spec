# Lottie Animation Format Documentation

This repository is for the development of the Lottie Animation Format.

All work here is guided by the [Community Specification License](Community_Specification_License-v1.md).


## Scope

The scope of this Working Group is to specify the format of the Lottie Animation Format, both
the allowed JSON structure, the semantics of that structure, and how such Lottie files are to be
rendered. The definition of the correct rendering will be specified by a combination of verbiage
in the written specification and by exemplar Lottie files and their desired renderings.


## CLA

Participation in this group requires signing the
[Contributor License Agreement](Notices.md), which you can
do by creating a pull request that adds your name, email address, and Community
Specification License version that you agree to be bound by.

Here is an [example of what that pull request should look like](https://github.com/lottie/lottie-spec/pull/9).
