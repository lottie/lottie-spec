<h1 id="community-specification-license-10">Community Specification License 1.0</h1>
<p><strong>The Purpose of this License.</strong> This License sets forth the terms under
which 1) Contributor will participate in and contribute to the development of
specifications, standards, best practices, guidelines, and other similar
materials under this Working Group, and 2) how the materials developed under
this License may be used. It is not intended for source code. Capitalized terms
are defined in the License’s last section.</p>
<p><strong>1. Copyright.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1. Copyright License.</strong> Contributor grants everyone a non-sublicensable,
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as expressly stated in this License) copyright license, without any
obligation for accounting, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, and distribute any materials it submits to the full
extent of its copyright interest in those materials. Contributor also
acknowledges that the Working Group may exercise copyright rights in the
Specification, including the rights to submit the Specification to another
standards organization.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Copyright Attribution.</strong> As a condition, anyone exercising this copyright
license must include attribution to the Working Group in any derivative work
based on materials developed by the Working Group. That attribution must
include, at minimum, the material’s name, version number, and source from where
the materials were retrieved. Attribution is not required for implementations of
the Specification.</p>
<p><strong>2. Patents.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1. Patent License.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1.1. As a Result of Contributions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1.1.1. As a Result of Contributions to Draft Specifications.</strong> Contributor
grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this
License) license to its Necessary Claims in 1) Contributor’s Contributions
and 2) to the Draft Specification that is within Scope as of the date of that
Contribution, in both cases for Licensee’s Implementation of the Draft
Specification, except for those patent claims excluded by Contributor under
Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.1.2. For Approved Specifications.</strong> Contributor grants Licensee a
non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) license to its
Necessary Claims included the Approved Specification that are within Scope for
Licensee’s Implementation of the Approved Specification, except for those patent
claims excluded by Contributor under Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.2. Patent Grant from Licensee.</strong> Licensee grants each other Licensee a
non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) license to its
Necessary Claims for its Implementation, except for those patent claims excluded
under Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.3. Licensee Acceptance.</strong> The patent grants set forth in Section 2.1
extend only to Licensees that have indicated their agreement to this License as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>2.1.3.1. Source Code Distributions.</strong> For distribution in source code, by
including this License in the root directory of the source code with the
Implementation;</p>
<p><strong>2.1.3.2. Non-Source Code Distributions.</strong> For distribution in any form other
than source code, by including this License in the documentation, legal notices,
via notice in the software, and/or other written materials provided with the
Implementation; or</p>
<p><strong>2.1.3.3. Via Notices.md.</strong> By issuing pull request or commit to the
Specification’s repository’s Notices.md file by the Implementer’s authorized
representative, including the Implementer’s name, authorized individual and
system identifier, and Specification version.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.4. Defensive Termination.</strong> If any Licensee files or maintains a claim in
a court asserting that a Necessary Claim is infringed by an Implementation, any
licenses granted under this License to the Licensee are immediately terminated
unless 1) that claim is directly in response to a claim against Licensee
regarding an Implementation, or 2) that claim was brought to enforce the terms
of this License, including intervention in a third-party action by a Licensee.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.5. Additional Conditions.</strong> This License is not an assurance (i) that any
of Contributor’s copyrights or issued patent claims cover an Implementation of
the Specification or are enforceable or (ii) that an Implementation of the
Specification would not infringe intellectual property rights of any third
party.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Patent Licensing Commitment.</strong> In addition to the rights granted in
Section 2.1, Contributor agrees to grant everyone a no charge, royalty-free
license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to Contributor’s Necessary
Claims that are within Scope for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementations of a Draft Specification, where such license applies only to
   those Necessary Claims infringed by implementing Contributor's
   Contribution(s) included in that Draft Specification, and</li>
<li>Implementations of the Approved Specification.</li>
</ol>
<p>This patent licensing commitment does not apply to those claims subject to
Contributor’s Exclusion Notice under Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Effect of Withdrawal.</strong> Contributor may withdraw from the Working Group
by issuing a pull request or commit providing notice of withdrawal to the
Working Group repository’s Notices.md file. All of Contributor’s existing
commitments and obligations with respect to the Working Group up to the date of
that withdrawal notice will remain in effect, but no new obligations will be
incurred.</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Binding Encumbrance.</strong> This License is binding on any future owner,
assignee, or party who has been given the right to enforce any Necessary Claims
against third parties.</p>
<p><strong>3. Patent Exclusion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1. As a Result of Contributions.</strong> Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims
from its licensing commitments incurred under Section 2.1.1 by issuing an
Exclusion Notice within 45 days of the date of that Contribution. Contributor
may not issue an Exclusion Notice for any material that has been included in a
Draft Deliverable for more than 45 days prior to the date of that Contribution.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved
Specification.</strong> Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an Approved
Specification, Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from its licensing
commitments under this Agreement by issuing an Exclusion Notice. Contributor may
not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents that were eligible to have been
excluded pursuant to Section 3.1.</p>
<p><strong>4. Source Code License.</strong> Any source code developed by the Working Group is
solely subject the source code license included in the Working Group’s
repository for that code. If no source code license is included, the source code
will be subject to the MIT License.</p>
<p><strong>5. No Other Rights.</strong> Except as specifically set forth in this License, no
other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other rights are
granted under this License, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Antitrust Compliance.</strong> Contributor acknowledge that it may compete with
other participants in various lines of business and that it is therefore
imperative that they and their respective representatives act in a manner that
does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations. This License
does not restrict any Contributor from engaging in similar specification
development projects. Each Contributor may design, develop, manufacture, acquire
or market competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its
business, in whatever way it chooses. No Contributor is obligated to announce or
market any products or services. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any
product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of
markets, allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed
among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group.</p>
<p><strong>7. Non-Circumvention.</strong> Contributor agrees that it will not intentionally take
or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of
circumventing any obligations under this License.</p>
<p><strong>8. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.1. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers.</strong> Contributor and Licensee
represents and warrants that 1) it is legally entitled to grant the rights set
forth in this License and 2) it will not intentionally include any third party
materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms
that do not conflict with this License. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS
ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the
Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except
as stated herein, CONTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES
(EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITIONS
OF QUALITY, OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION. IN NO
EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM
OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM
ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED
ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR
NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Any
obligations regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of
Necessary Claims will be satisfied if Contributor or Licensee notifies the
transferee or assignee of any patent that it knows contains Necessary Claims or
necessary claims under this License. Nothing in this License requires
Contributor to undertake a patent search. If Contributor is 1) employed by or
acting on behalf of an employer, 2) is making a Contribution under the direction
or control of a third party, or 3) is making the Contribution as a consultant,
contractor, or under another similar relationship with a third party,
Contributor represents that they have been authorized by that party to enter
into this License on its behalf.</p>
<p><strong>8.2. Distribution Disclaimer.</strong> Any distributions of technical information to
third parties must include a notice materially similar to the following: “THESE
MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” The Contributors and Licensees expressly
disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied
warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular
purpose, or title, related to the materials. The entire risk as to implementing
or otherwise using the materials is assumed by the implementer and user. IN NO
EVENT WILL THE CONTRIBUTORS OR LICENSEES BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST
PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS
DELIVERABLE OR ITS GOVERNING AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER MEMBER
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.”</p>
<p><strong>9. Definitions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1. Affiliate.</strong> “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly
Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control of that party.</p>
<p><strong>9.2. Approved Specification.</strong> “Approved Specification” means the final
version and contents of any Draft Specification designated as an Approved
Specification as set forth in the accompanying Governance.md file.</p>
<p><strong>9.3. Contribution.</strong> “Contribution” means any original work of authorship,
including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that Contributor
submits for inclusion in a Draft Specification, which is included in a Draft
Specification or Approved Specification.</p>
<p><strong>9.4. Contributor.</strong> “Contributor” means any person or entity that has
indicated its acceptance of the License 1) by making a Contribution to the
Specification, or 2) by entering into the Community Specification Contributor
License Agreement for the Specification. Contributor includes its Affiliates,
assigns, agents, and successors in interest.</p>
<p><strong>9.5. Control.</strong> “Control” means direct or indirect control of more than 50% of

<p><strong>9.7. Exclusion Notice.</strong> “Exclusion Notice” means a written notice made by
making a pull request or commit to the repository’s Notices.md file that
identifies patents that Contributor is excluding from its patent licensing
commitments under this License. The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and
published applications must include the Draft Specification’s name, patent
number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of
the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that the Contributor is
excluding from the royalty-free licensing commitment set forth in this License.
If an issued patent or pending patent application that may contain Necessary
Claims is not set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Necessary Claims shall
continue to be subject to the licensing commitments under this License. The
Exclusion Notice for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i)
the text of the filed application; or (ii) identification of the specific
part(s) of the Draft Specification whose implementation makes the excluded claim
